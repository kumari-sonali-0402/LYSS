<h2>Names and epithets</h2><hr>
<p>The name "Krishna" originates from the Sanskrit word kṛṣṇa, which means "black",<br>"dark" or "dark blue".The waning moon is called Krishna Paksha, relating to<br>the adjective meaning "darkening".Some Vaishnavas also translate the word as "All-<br>Attractive", though it lacks that meaning in Sanskrit.<br>
As a name of Vishnu, Krishna is listed as the 57th name in the Vishnu Sahasranama.<br>Based on his name, Krishna is often depicted in idols as black- or blue-skinned. Krishna<br> is also known by various other names, epithets, and titles that reflect his many <br>associations and attributes. Among the most common names are Mohan "enchanter";<br>Govinda "chief herdsman", Keev "prankster", and Gopala "Protector of the 'Go'",<br> which means "soul" or "the cows". Some names for Krishna hold regional<br> importance; Jagannatha, found in the Puri Hindu temple, is a popular incarnation in<br> Odisha state and nearby regions of eastern India.</p>
<h2>Historical and literary sources</h2><hr>
<p>The tradition of Krishna appears to be an amalgamation of several independent deities<br>of ancient India, the earliest to be attested being Vāsudeva. Vāsudeva was a hero-<br>god of the tribe of the Vrishnis, belonging to the Vrishni heroes, whose worship is<br>attested from the 5th–6th century BCE in the writings of Pāṇini, and from the 2nd<br>century BCE in epigraphy with the Heliodorus pillar. At one point in time, it is thought <br>that the tribe of the Vrishnis fused with the tribe of the Yadavas, whose own hero-god<br> was named Krishna. Vāsudeva and Krishna fused to become a single deity, which<br>appears in the Mahabharata, and they started to be identified with Vishnu in the<br> Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita.Around the 4th century CE, another tradition,<br>the cult of Gopala-Krishna of the Ābhīras, the protector of cattle, was also absorbed into<br> the Krishna tradition.
